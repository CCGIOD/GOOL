GOOL
====

Description
===

The most widely used Object-Oriented Programming languages (Java, C++, C#, Android, Objective C) are all roughly the same; so long as one does not enter device-dependent programming (GUI, H/W, ...). In fact, all the core constructs of these languages can be translated into one another.

GOOL stands for General Object-Oriented Language. It is that subset of Java that easily translates into the other languages. Hence, programming something in GOOL means programming in C++, C# etc. at the same time. Put in another way, GOOL is a core-Java to C++, C# translator. It produces clean, readable code.

The structure of the project is so that more target languages can be added, and more primitives be translated. The final objective is not to reach a comprehensive translator. The aim is to provide a tool that lets you write device-independent pieces of programs for many target languages, in one go.
